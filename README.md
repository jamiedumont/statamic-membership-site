# Membership site with Statamic

This is a companion repo to a tutorial published on [my site](https://www.jamiedumont.co.uk//blog/build-a-membership-site-with-statamic/).

It does not include the core `/statamic` files, nor the source code of [Charge](https://silentzconsulting.com/addons/charge), a plugin used in the development of this example. [Statamic](https://statamic.com?rfsn=1078755.9626a) is free to try locally, but Charge is not, hence why it is not present in this repo.
